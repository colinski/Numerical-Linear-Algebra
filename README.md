These files were created for coursework in Math/CS 513 at UW-Madison.

Some of functions are dependent on other functions (QRSolve uses QRFactor for example), so the whole package needs to be downloaded in order to be used.

There is no error checking in this code. So, for example, if a non-square matrix is passed to a function expecting a square matrix, the program will crash or give garbage output.

Commenting is rather sparse, so I will include links to the concepts covered below (all credit to the original authors):
